### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vladimir. I am a software developer at Kaspersky Lab working on [KasperskyOS](https://os.kaspersky.com/), a foundation for secure-by-design solutions.

Apart from my occupation, my main interests are in real-time graphics rendering, game development, software design and architecture, and DevOps practices.

Here on GitHub, I keep my hobby-projects and contribute to open-source.
